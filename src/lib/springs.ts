/**
 * Motion tokens, ported from fluid-functionalism.
 * Each tier's value is the ENTER transition — a critically damped spring,
 * except the largest tier which keeps a little bounce. Its `.exit` is the
 * matching EXIT transition — a plain tween, no bounce, one tier quicker —
 * so a dismissal reads as crisp and final rather than replaying the
 * entrance in reverse.
 *
 *   transition={spring.fast}                              // enter
 *   exit={{ opacity: 0, transition: spring.fast.exit }}   // leave
 *
 * The bigger the thing that moves, the slower the spring. Never hand-write
 * a duration — always reach for a tier.
